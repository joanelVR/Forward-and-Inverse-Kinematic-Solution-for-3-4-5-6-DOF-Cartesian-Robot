# Forward-and-Inverse-Kinematic-Solution-for-3-4-5-6-DOF-Cartesian-Robot
##### The machine was treated as a multi-link system and the use of forward and inverse kinematic analysis on each joint provided the needed information in order to fully describe the motion of the system. With this, a mathematical model was then created that fully described the position and mobility of these joints. This mathematical model was then solved using MATLAB. These analysis were applied to four different stages of the machine (3DOF, 4DOF, 5DOF and 6DOF), allowing us to explore and compare the different results that could be obtained at each stage.

##### A MATLAB function was created for each stage of the machine. These functions take the (x,y,z) position of the end effector, as well as the initial plane of motion and initial position of the machine. With this information, the MATLAB function calculates the position of each link, as well as the necessary rotation of the revolute joints.
